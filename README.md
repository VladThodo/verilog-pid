# Verilog PID controller
This was developed as part of my Bachelor's diploma project. It is a full system capable of communicating with a computer via serial UART and reading data from a serial-capable sensor. It can be adapted to any sort of sensor without too much difficulty.

The GitHub documentation is still under development. If you think this project might help ypu, please reach out to me for more detailed information.
